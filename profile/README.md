Introducing CarbonTracker, an innovative project that harnesses the power of IoT devices and blockchain technology to monitor and quantify the amount of carbon emitted by companies. Our cutting-edge platform allows these emissions to be efficiently and transparently offset, promoting sustainable practices and encouraging businesses to take action to reduce their carbon footprint.

Our mission is to provide a secure and transparent solution for companies to monitor and offset their carbon emissions. By leveraging IoT sensors, we can precisely monitor climate action and accurately measure the exact amount of carbon emissions. Based on this information, our platform determines the amount of carbon credits needed to offset a company's emissions.

Monitoring carbon emissions not only helps companies comply with carbon emission regulations but also enables them to identify areas where they can reduce emissions and cut costs.

In addition to cost savings, social responsibility is a compelling reason for companies to monitor their carbon emissions. Companies can demonstrate their commitment to mitigating climate change and contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, thereby improving their image and reputation. This is especially important among consumers who prioritize sustainability.

Join us in our fight against climate change by leveraging technology to create a more sustainable future. Together, we can make carbon offsetting accessible to all and create positive change for the planet.

## How the solutions works

CarbonTracker's business logic relies on a smart contract that receives and analyzes sensor data to determine the amount of carbon that needs to be offset for each company. The smart contract is unique to each company and stores information related to CO2 emissions.

CarbonTracker uses cutting-edge technology to help companies offset their carbon emissions. A gas sensor is used to capture the amount of carbon emitted, and the data is transmitted via the MQTT protocol to a backend, where it is stored on the blockchain using EtherJS.
On the frontend, the solution allows companies to purchase carbon credits from Toucan, and by buying a token, it's possible to offset the amount of carbon emitted by "retiring" the token and contributing to a more sustainable future. In addition, all transactions related to the purchase of carbon credits are recorded on the blockchain, making the information transparent and easily accessible to all involved in the platform.

To further encourage companies to commit to offsetting their carbon emissions, the CarbonTracker solution includes a leaderboard. This feature shows the companies that are offsetting the most carbon emissions and recognizes and encourages companies to lead the way towards a more sustainable future.
